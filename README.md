# Perceptron

A Perceptron that guesses the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The perceptron is trained with a set number of epochs, making the 
proper adjustments of the weights. The inputs are two sides of the right traingle and the output is the guess. With 10,000 epochs,
a 0.1 learning rate, and a training set of 4 pieces of data makes a very close guess to the actual hypotenuse. The ideal weights
would be as close to 1 as possible and makes a more accurate guess the closer the weights end up being to 1.
